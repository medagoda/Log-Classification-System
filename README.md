# üîç Log Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on automating the classification of log messages (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, etc.) using machine learning techniques. It aims to help developers and system administrators quickly identify and respond to critical system events.

## üìå Features

- Preprocessing of raw log data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Supervised ML models for classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix and classification reports for performance insights
- Scalable pipeline for future integration into monitoring systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)


## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-classification.git
   cd log-classification
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run preprocessing and training:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/preprocess.py
python src/train_model.py
Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/evaluate.py
üìä Results
Accuracy: 92%

F1-score: 0.91

Confusion matrix indicates strong performance in identifying ERROR and WARNING logs.

üìå Future Work
Integration with live log streams

Real-time classification using deep learning (e.g., LSTM)

Visualization dashboard with alerts
